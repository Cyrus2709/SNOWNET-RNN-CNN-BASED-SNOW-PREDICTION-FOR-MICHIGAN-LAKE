SnowNet - Snow Condition Prediction in the Michigan Lake Region

SnowNet is an innovative machine learning model developed to predict snow conditions in the Michigan Lake region. Leveraging advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), SnowNet provides accurate and timely snow condition forecasts by analyzing a diverse dataset of meteorological features and high-resolution lake images.

Project Overview

Problem Statement: Predicting snow conditions in the Michigan Lake region is crucial for various stakeholders, including winter sports enthusiasts, transportation agencies, and emergency services. SnowNet addresses this challenge by harnessing the power of machine learning.
Data Source: We have curated a comprehensive dataset comprising 50,000 rows of meteorological data and high-resolution lake images. This dataset has been meticulously preprocessed and integrated to ensure optimal model performance.
Technical Approach: SnowNet utilizes advanced RNN and CNN architectures to process the input data and make predictions. The combination of these models allows us to capture both temporal dependencies in the meteorological data and spatial features in the lake images.
Accuracy: SnowNet has been rigorously tested and evaluated, demonstrating exceptional technical prowess with a remarkable accuracy rate of 92.48% in snow condition prediction.
